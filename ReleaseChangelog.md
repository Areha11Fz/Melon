This is a small feature update. Generated assemblies should be fully compatible with those generated by 0.4.16.x.  
  
New features:
 * PDB generator project (not bundled in release zip) - see README
 * New CLI option `--add-prefix-to` to add Il2Cpp prefix to additional assemblies and namespaces to prevent conflicts with managed libs.
