This is a small bugfix and feature update. Generated assemblies should be mostly compatible with those generated by 0.4.15.x.  
However, this version fixes a bug in deobfuscation map handling that can result in more things being renamed. This can lead to some breakage.  
New features:
 * Interface implementations for injected classes (contributed by @HookedBehemoth in #71). See README for more details  
 * Delegate types get generated operators + and - for easier handling of delegate-typed fields (contributed by @HookedBehemoth).

Changes:
 * Fixed field and enum field renames from deobfuscation map not being applied
 * Xref scanner now considers CMOVcc opcodes for string references
 * Fixed deobfuscation map generator failing to run (it still generates bad maps for deobfuscated types though - some postprocessing is required)
 * Fixed newer Unity versions failing due to wrong native struct description
 * 0.4.16.1 - fixed binary compatibility of ClassInjector API (at the cost of breaking binary compatibility with 0.4.16.0)
 * 0.4.16.2 - fixed invalid IL error when injecting methods returning non-primitive value types (contributed by @Kasuromi in #75)
