This is a small bugfix update. Generated assemblies should be mostly compatible with those generated by 0.4.14.0.  
Some external tools that relied on native struct definitions might break though - some structs were moved to used the wrapper model.  
Changes:
 * Generic structs are now always (correctly) generated as non-blittable
 * Rewrote native struct handling to enable easy support of different Unity versions.
   * This release should, in theory, support all Unity versions from 2017.1.0 to 2020.2.x and perhaps even above. However, bugs are still a thing.
   * The base of this was contributed by @ghorsington in #35
   * Some fixes and improvements here were contributed by @ds5678 (#39)
 * Added `Il2CppObjectBase.WasCollected` (contributed by @ds5678 in #37)
 * Added basic support for loading custom components (of injected types) from assetbundles (contributed by @ds5678 in #38)
 * Added an overload of `Il2CppType.Of` method that doesn't throw exceptions for non-found types (contributed by @ds5678 in #36)
